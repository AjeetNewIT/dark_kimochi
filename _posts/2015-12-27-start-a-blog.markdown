## What is Jekyll?

> a simple, blog aware, static site generator

Yeah that is Jekyll<br>
Jekyll is a parsing engine bundled using ruby gems to build text plain and generating into static website and blogs. Even jekyll can generate dynamic contents such as liquid code, template, etc.
I have already start a blog with Tumblr, but i don't know, i feel so uncomfortable.
I'm looking jekyll from google, and learn how to use jekyll, met bla bla bla.<br>
Jekyll is the right choices to start a blogging software for me.
